## Lead developpers

Simcoon and Fedoo are mainly developed and maintained by the 3MAH Team of the I2M laboratory in Bordeaux. Both are released under the GNU General Public License: GPL, version 3.
Yves Chemisky is currently Full Professor at the University of Bordeaux. Etienne Prulière is currently Associate professor at Arts et Métiers, Bordeaux. 


## Institutions 

Simcoon is a collaborative effort from researchers around the world. See below the main public institutions that are contributing to this collaborative effort

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Main academic partners that contribute to the development of Simcoon: Université de Bordeaux, Arts et Métiers, and CNRS" %}

Those three institutions gather their research efforts in a single research Institute : I2M. This research Institute includes a large range of topics related to research fields in mechanical engineering on the campus of the University of Bordeaux, France. 
I2M is part within several projects connected to design the industry of the future, functional materials, sustainable housing or to prevent deterioration of famous historical sites as the cave of Lascaux. Such projects are supported by skills acquired and developed in the field of multiscale physical phenomena within heterogeneous media and systems, either using experimental approaches (from microscopy to process instrumentation), or the numerical tools (such as Simcoon and fedOO, but you shall have a look at Notus in fluid mechanics, anf granOO for discrete element method for granular materials modeling). 

Other institutions have participated or are using Simcoon and fedOO around the world:

* TU Bergakademie Freiberg : Top level School of Mines in Germany
* LEM3: Laboratory devoted to the study of Microstructures and Mechanics of Materials in Metz, France.
* TIMC-IMAG : Medical Engineering laboratory in Grenoble, France
* Texas A&M University : Top University in Texas, USA.
