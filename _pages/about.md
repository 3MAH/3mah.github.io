Simcoon is a C++ library with emphasis on speed and ease-of-use. Its principle focus is to provide tools to facilitate the implementation of up-to-date constitutive model for materials in Finite Element Analysis Packages. This is done by providing a C++ API to generate user material subroutine based on a library of functions. Also, SMART+ provides tools to analyse the behavior of material, considering loading at the material point level.

Simcoon is mainly developed by Yves Chemisky, currently appointed scientist at the CNRS and by contributors from the staff and students of Arts et Métiers ParisTech, that are members of the LEM3 laboratory. It is released under the GNU General Public License: GPL, version 3.

Several institutions have contributed to the development of Simcoon:
* Arts et Métiers ParisTech : Top French school of engineers, focused on technology and applications.
* LEM3: Laboratory devoted to the study of Microstructures and Mechanics of Materials in Metz, France.
* TIMC-IMAG : Medical Engineering laboratory in Grenoble, France
* CNRS : National French Center for scientific research. The LEM3 laboratory is labelled from the CNRS.
* Texas A&M University : Top University in Texas, USA.
