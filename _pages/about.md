    excerpt: 'Simcoon is a C++ library with emphasis on speed and ease-of-use. Its principle focus is to provide tools to facilitate the implementation of up-to-date constitutive model for materials in Finite Element Analysis Packages. This is done by providing a C++ API to generate user material subroutine based on a library of functions. Also, SMART+ provides tools to analyse the behavior of material, considering loading at the material point level.'

{% include feature_row id="intro" type="left" %}

* Simcoon consists in an Application Programming Interface (API) developped in C++ and exposed in Python. 

* It relies on the high quality linear algebra library C++ library Armadillo. This provides a perfect balance between speed and ease of use 
 
* It can be used as a standalone solver tool for the numerical simulation of material's thermomechanical response, or coupled to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) packages for the simulation of complex structures 

* Provide efficient material constitutive law for anisotropic elasticity, plasticity, visco√©lasticity, phase transformation
