## History of API of simcoon

### v1.2
Addition of Finite strain framework

### v1.1
Addition of thermomechanical constitutive laws for:
* elasticity, plasticity, phase transformation (shape memory alloys)

### v1.0 
Stable version of simcoon that contained the followinf features: 
* Non-linear solver working with infinitesimal strains
* constitutive equations for elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, phase transformation (shape memory alloys)
* identification tool
* micromechanical algorithms

### v0.9 
First release of simcoon: Basic features from the former 'smartplus' library
